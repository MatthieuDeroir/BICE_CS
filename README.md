🎯 Usage

This system aims to automate material management that was previously managed manually via Excel files. The system provides functions for managing materials, vehicles, and the history of interventions. It also helps in observing the usage rules of each material and determining whether a material is usable, needs to be checked, or must be discarded.

🌟 Features of B.I.C.E. Management System

The B.I.C.E. Management System is designed to address the specific needs of an emergency response team. The system facilitates material and vehicle management, allowing for efficient deployment and utilization of resources. Here are some of the unique features of the application:

Vehicle Management 🚒: The system allows for the addition, modification, and deactivation of vehicles. It keeps track of all vehicles that have been used at least once for historical reference.

Material Stock Management 📦: The application supports updating existing material stock via CSV files. It handles complex files that contain all necessary information such as material number, denomination, category, usage counts, and expiry dates.

Vehicle Stock Management 🚐: The system manages the list of materials stored in each vehicle. By providing a CSV file, users can update the inventory in a specific vehicle.

Intervention Return Management 🏥: On return from an intervention, the system allows for two types of file generation per vehicle: one for unused material and another for used material. It evaluates the usage rules for each material, updates usage counts, and decides if the material should be discarded or retained for future use.

Data Export 📊: The system supports the export of material stock data in CSV format, along with information specifying the vehicle in which it is stored. It also allows for exporting a list of materials that need to be removed from stock or checked.

Lost Material Tracking 📍: The system identifies and tracks lost materials that were initially in the vehicle but are not found upon return.

Automated Material Rules Application 🤖: The system automatically applies the material usage rules, ensuring the safety of the responders and the public.

Intervention History Recording 📖: For record-keeping purposes, the system stores the history of all interventions, including date, description, and the vehicles involved.

These features aim to automate and streamline the management of resources, ensuring that the B.I.C.E. can focus on its primary mission: saving lives under extreme conditions.
